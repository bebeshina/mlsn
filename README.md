## Multiingual Lexical Semantic Network (MLSN) building tools and data.

**About**
The present research work is intended to show how a domain specific lexical semantic network can be built in an industrial context and how it can be used in order to assist ontology modeling. Ontology building is a costly process often done manually. ln the same time, non ontological knowledge resources are available and mature. Among those, lexical semantic networks can be exploited in order to model domain specific knowledge in a semantically explicit way with sense refinements and concern multiple languages. Given such domain specific multilingual lexical semantic network, a mediatory terminological and ontological resource can be extracted from this network and viewed as a projection of a given knowledge model (i.e. ontology) onto the domain specific lexical semantic network. Such mediatory resource can support the top down ontology building process as it contains ontological structures that can be used by the human experts during knowledge acquisition and modeling. This work stems from the artificial intelligence approach focused on life-long learning (the network is continuously improved by the processes it is used by) and from text based ontology building approaches.
